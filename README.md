EduDrift AI is an intelligent learning analytics platform designed to detect concept drift in student learning behavior.

Traditional learning systems evaluate students mainly using final scores. However, learning behavior changes over time. Students may improve, struggle, or disengage.

EduDrift analyzes behavioral learning patterns and detects these changes early using AI-driven drift detection techniques.

📌 Problem

Online learning platforms generate large amounts of student interaction data such as:

Quiz attempts

Coding exercise submissions

Time spent per question

Accuracy trends

Assignment completion behavior

Despite this rich data, most platforms only analyze final performance metrics.

This leads to several problems:

Struggling students are detected too late

Educators lack behavioral insights

Learning personalization becomes difficult

The missing component is Concept Drift Detection in learning behavior.

💡 Solution

EduDrift AI introduces a system that continuously analyzes student learning interactions and detects when their learning behavior changes.

The system:

Collects interaction data

Extracts behavioral features

Detects drift in learning patterns

Generates insights and visual analytics

This enables real-time adaptive learning insights.

🌐 Live Demo

Frontend Interface:

https://edudrift-ai.vercel.app

The demo includes:

Student analytics dashboard

Learning behavior heatmaps

Performance trend graphs

Concept drift indicators

Interactive visualizations

🧠 Core Idea

EduDrift focuses on how students learn, not just their final scores.

Key behavioral signals analyzed include:

Response time changes

Accuracy fluctuations

Attempt frequency

Learning speed

Topic mastery progression

These signals help detect learning pattern drift.
